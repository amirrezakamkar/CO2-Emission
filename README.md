# CO2-Emission Data Analysis and ML Project

## Overview
In this project, I've worked on a dataset provided by European Comission about the CO2 emission in each country from 1970 to 2021. The dataset consist information regarding these three topics: 
- Total CO2 emission
- CO2 emission in each sector
- CO2 emission per GDP
In addition to that, I used another dataset with more information about the energy production and consumption in each country from 2000 to 2020, to train a machine learning model for CO2 emission.
The datasets can be seen in the following links:

## Data Analysis
Data analysis was conducted using MySQL for database creation and basic queries, along with the Pandas library in Python for advanced analysis. The primary objective was to group countries based on their economy and Environmental Performance Index (EPI) and compare CO2 emissions among these groups across different time periods.

## Machine learning
A separate dataset containing numerical data on energy production and consumption was used to train the machine learning model for predicting CO2 emissions.

## Conclusion
- Global CO2 emissions are increasing, but environmentally progressive nations provide valuable lessons.
- Developing countries must reduce emissions with support from developed nations, which have significantly contributed to the issue.
- Electricity production is the major driver of CO2 emissions, emphasizing the need for a rapid shift to renewable energy.
- Achieving net-zero is only possible through global cooperation and equitable contributions from all countries.
- An ML model can predict CO2 emissions for each country, serving as a key tool to track progress toward net-zero goals.
